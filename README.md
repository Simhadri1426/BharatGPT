## 📌 Problem Statement
India has over **1.4 billion people** speaking **22+ major languages** and hundreds of dialects.  
Yet, most AI tools and digital services are available **only in English**.  

⚠️ This creates huge barriers for:
- Students in rural areas (limited access to AI-driven learning).  
- Small business owners (unable to use English-first tools).  
- Citizens needing government/health information in their **native language**.

## 💡 Our Solution: BharatGPT
**BharatGPT** is an **AI-powered multilingual assistant** designed specifically for India.  
It empowers every Indian to access knowledge, guidance, and digital services in **their own language**.  

### ✨ Key Features
- 🌐 **Multilingual Support** – Converse in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil… (more languages coming).  
- 🎓 **AI Tutor** – Personalized learning in native languages.  
- 🏥 **Healthcare Helper** – Basic health guidance with voice/text support.  
- 📜 **Govt. Schemes Simplified** – Explains policies in plain local language.  
- 🎙️ **Voice-to-Text & Text-to-Voice** – For accessibility in rural/low-literacy areas.  
- 📱 **Mobile-First** – Lightweight design that works on smartphones.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **APIs Used:**  
  - 🧠 OpenAI **GPT-4** → Multilingual Q&A, contextual support  
  - 🎙️ OpenAI **Whisper** → Voice input → Text  
  - 🎨 OpenAI **DALL·E** → Infographics & visuals for education  
  - 🔊 **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** → Conversational audio replies  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. User asks a **question in their own language** (voice or text).  
2. **Whisper API** → converts speech to text.  
3. **GPT-4** → processes and generates the response in the same language.  
4. **TTS engine** → delivers the answer back in **natural-sounding speech**.  
5. **Optional visuals** via DALL·E for education & awareness.

## 📅 Roadmap
- ✅ **Phase 1 – Prototype**: Build Hindi, Telugu, Tamil chatbot using GPT + Whisper.  
- 🔄 **Phase 2 – Expansion**: Add more languages & domain-specific datasets (education, healthcare, governance).  
- 📱 **Phase 3 – Deployment**: Mobile app with offline-lite mode for rural connectivity.
